# haproxy vim plugin

The syntax file was originally copied from haproxy-1.5-dev17.  Since then, it has been re-worked, with especial emphasis on highlighting ACLs.

Pull requests are welcomed.

The easiest way to install this plugin is through [vim-polyglot](https://github.com/sheerun/vim-polyglot).
